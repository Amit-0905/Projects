Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to showcasing various machine learning and deep learning projects! This folder serves as a hub for my experimentation, learning, and implementation of key concepts in artificial intelligence.

Folder Structure
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks or colab notebook.
Scripts: Python scripts implementing machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
Models: Saved model architectures and weights for easy reuse and sharing.
Results: Visualizations, reports, and performance metrics for the models.
Projects Included
Each project covers different aspects of machine learning and deep learning, including but not limited to:

Supervised Learning: Classification and regression tasks utilizing algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction methods such as K-means and PCA.
Deep Learning: Neural network architectures including CNNs for image processing and RNNs for sequence prediction.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling using state-of-the-art approaches.
